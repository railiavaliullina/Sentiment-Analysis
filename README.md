## About The Project

This project contains:

    1) code for computing vector representations of reviews using ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models);
    2) implementation of RNN, CNN neural networks as baselines;
    3) implementation of Biattentive Classification Network + Maxout Network (BCN) from paper:

        McCann B. et al. Learned in translation: Contextualized word vectors, 2017

    4) implementation of Biattentive Classification Network + ReLU Feedforward Network (modification of BCN) from paper:

        Peters, Matthew E., et al. Deep contextualized word representations, 2018

    5) implementation of models training pipeline;
    6) comparison of all implemented models results.
